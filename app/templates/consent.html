      My name is Joseph Tey, and I am a Year 10 student currently undertaking a VCE 3/4 subject known as Extended Investigation. For my research, I have created a flashcard website that helps students to memorise vocabulary words more efficiently. This experiment, aims to test the effectiveness of the website.
      <br><br>
      To ensure quality data, I would greatly appreciate it if you could follow the instructions below, and actively participate during this short experiment.
      <br><br>
      <b style="font-size:20px">Why should I do this?</b> <br>
      <ol style="font-size:15px">
        <li>If you're unsure of effective ways to memorise vocabulary, this may help.</li>
        <li>A <b>TEST</b> will be conducted tomorrow; this is your only opportunity to revise for the test.</li>
      </ol><br>

      <b style="font-size:20px">Before you start...</b> <br />

      As certain times, you may feel demotivated or stressed out. If this happens, please continue to try your best â€“ the experiment is designed to be deliberately difficult.
